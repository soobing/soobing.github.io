    gatsby new my-default-starter https://github.com/zoomkoding/zoomkoding-gatsby-blog
    ```

1.  **Start developing.**

    Navigate into your new site‚Äôs directory and start it up.

    ```shell
    cd my-default-starter/
    gatsby develop
    ```

1.  **Open the source code and start editing!**

    Your site is now running at `http://localhost:8000`!

    _Note: You'll also see a second link: _`http://localhost:8000/___graphql`_. This is a tool you can use to experiment with querying your data. Learn more about using this tool in the [Gatsby tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/tutorial/part-five/#introducing-graphiql)._

## ‚öôÔ∏è Next Steps

You can customize your blog by modifying contents of `gatsby-meta-config.js`

### 1. default

Provide your blog's title, description, author, siteUrl, ogImage, social Information(`title` is used as the blog name in the upper left corner.)

```js
module.exports = {
    title: '', // zoomkoding.dev
    description: '', // zoomkoding's dev log
    author: '', // zoomkoding

    siteUrl: '', // https://zoomkoding-gatsby-blog.netlify.com
    ogImage: '', // open graph image (image displayed when the link is shared)
    social: {
        github: '', // https://github.com/zoomKoding
        linkedIn: '', // https://www.linkedin.com/in/jinhyeok-jeong-800871192
        email: '', // zoomkoding@gmail.com
    },
    ...
}
```

### 2. bio

**bio(Biography** is a section introducing the blog author.  
For `description`, you can introduce yourself by adding multiple phrases. If you want to **add your Memoji**, replace the video file named `src/assets/author.mp4`.

```js
module.exports = {
    ...

    bio: {
        language: 'en', // en, ko
        name: '', // author name
        description: [''], // phases to describe who you are
    },
    ...
}
```

### 3. comments

If you want to have comments for your blog postings, please provide your github repository which is connected to `utterances`.

> ü¶Ñ If you want to know how to set up utterances for your repository, read [https://utteranc.es/](https://utteranc.es/)

    comments: {
        utterances: {
            repo: '' // zoomkoding/zoomkoding-gatsby-blog
        },
    },
    ...
}
```

## üë§ About Page

You can also generate **About Page** with `gatsby-meta-config.js`. In the file, you can find timestamps and projects under about. If you provide information in the correct format, your About Page will be generated.

### 1. timestamps

If you provide each timestamp information in an array as shown below, it will be displayed in the timestamps section according to the order you entered.

> If there is no such information in links, you can omit it.

```js
module.exports = {
    ...

    about: {
        timestamps: [
            {
                date: '', // date
                activity: '', // activity
                links: { // you can omit
                    post: '', // post link
                    googlePlay: '', // googlePlay link
                    appStore: '' // appStore link
                    github: '' // github repostory link
                },
            }
            ...
        ],
        ...
    },
    ...
}
```

### 2. projects

Similarly, if you provide information for each project in an array, it will be displayed in the projects section in the order you entered.

```js
module.exports = {
    ...

    about: {
        ...

        projects: [
            {
                title: '', // project title,
                description: '', // description
                techStack: ['flutter', 'nodejs'], //  tech stack
                thumbnailUrl: '', // thumbnail Url
                links: { // you can omit
                    post: '', // post link
                    googlePlay: '', // googlePlay link
                    appStore: '' // appStore link
                    github: '' // github repostory link
                },
            },
            ...
        ],
        ...
    },
    ...
}
```
